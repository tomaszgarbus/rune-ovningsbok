The Einang stone is believed to date back to around 300 AD, and for a long time was the oldest known runic stone from northwestern Europe.",
    "explanationAfter": "Excellent! As explained by Kristel Zilmer on Twitter (see sources): Moltke's reading - still commonly accepted - is: …daga-(t)(i)R runo faihido. He suggested that the start could be: [Ek Go]dagastiR rūnō faihidō, «I, GodagastiR, painted (wrote) the rune (i.e. the runic inscription)”. The singular rūnō can refer to the overall runic message.",

    "description": "In early 2023, this stone was announced to be the oldest known runic inscription to date. It was found in a cremation ground, in Hole near Tyrifjorden, Eastern Norway, by University of Oslo researchers. The inscriptions are dated between 1 and 250 AD. The stone itself is a 31x32 cm block of reddish-brown Ringerike sandstone.",
    "explanationAfter": "Great answer! The inscription, consisting of thin, shallow runes, is transliterated as \"Idiberug\". According to Kristel Zilmer, professor at Oslo's Museum of Cultural History: this could be name of a woman Idibera or a kin named Idiberung.",
