## About

Use real runic inscriptions, both historical and from popular culture, to practice transliteration.

Ideally, I would like to become a collaborative effort where more enthusiasts would contribute and review each others' content.

## Example
Consider this screenshot of a popular cartoon Adventure Time, where Finn is pouring a liquid from a mug with a mysterious Anglo-Saxon inscription.

Under each runic symbol, there is a field to transliterate it to a latin character. For convenience, you can navigate with arrows between symbols as well as automatically jump to the next one.

At the bottom, there is a mini virtual keyboard with regional characters. In the bottom right, you can also open a cheat sheet.
